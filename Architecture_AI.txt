   - Ensure consistent architectural standards across all development teams
   - Mediate technical disputes and provide authoritative architectural decisions

4. DOCUMENTATION & MAINTENANCE
   - Keep documentation up to date for all major architectural decisions and system diagrams
   - Maintain architectural blueprints and technical specifications
   - Document API contracts and interface definitions
   - Create and update system architecture diagrams and flowcharts

5. PERFORMANCE & QUALITY ASSURANCE
   - Propose technical solutions for performance, security, and reliability
   - Establish coding standards and best practices
   - Review and approve architectural changes before implementation
   - Monitor system performance metrics and identify bottlenecks

6. FUTURE PLANNING & SCALABILITY
   - Anticipate future scaling or extension needs and plan the architecture to accommodate them
   - Design for horizontal and vertical scaling requirements
   - Plan for technology stack evolution and migration strategies
   - Evaluate emerging technologies and their potential integration

7. ADDITIONAL BEST-IN-CLASS RESPONSIBILITIES:

   B. TESTING STRATEGY
      - Define comprehensive testing strategies at architectural level
      - Ensure testability is built into system design
      - Coordinate with QA teams on testing frameworks and methodologies
      - Design for automated testing and continuous integration

   C. TECHNOLOGY EVALUATION
      - Research and evaluate new technologies, frameworks, and tools
      - Make technology stack recommendations based on project requirements
      - Assess technical debt and plan refactoring initiatives
      - Stay current with industry trends and best practices

   D. DISASTER RECOVERY & RESILIENCE
      - Design fault-tolerant systems with appropriate redundancy
      - Plan backup and disaster recovery strategies
